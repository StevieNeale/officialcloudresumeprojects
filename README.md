Hi there, Stevie is here.

title: "Get hands-on with The Cloud Resume Challenge - and beyond"

This repository is the official source for the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev) and similar real-world projects you can use to build cloud and DevOps skills.

## What's the Cloud Resume Challenge?

See [the FAQ](/faq.md) for a full explanation of why this project exists and what it's designed to do.

## Where do I start?
Check the [AWS](/projects/aws), [Azure](/projects/azure), or [Google Cloud](/projects/google-cloud) folder to get started on the Cloud Resume Challenge instructions for that cloud. You should also join our [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/2PTwAth)

## Beyond the CRC
The original Cloud Resume Challenge touches on many of the skills that you need to become a professional cloud engineer. However, it's not exhaustive. 

For that reason, challengers often ask for ways to extend their Cloud Resume Challenge project that will give them more experience in areas like:
* Cloud security
* Cloud networking
* Data engineering
* Observability
* Automation and DevOps practices
* Linux and containerization
* Programming for the cloud (Python, Javascript, Go)


Throughout the [projects section](/projects), you'll find ideas for enhancing and expanding your cloud skills by adding to your core Cloud Resume Challenge project or building it in a different way. These projects assume you have a working resume site and are ready to take it to the next level. 

We also encourage you to pursue other types of hands-on projects that have nothing to do with the CRC (the [resources section](resources/resources.md) points to a few), but there's a ton of value in maintaining the same active project over time, seeing how it breaks, learning how to run it faster and cheaper or incorporate new tools and features. As Scott Hanselman has said, running real sites and scaling them is [THE way to lock in your skills](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1507571200024735747).

New challenges are regularly added to this page by Forrest Brazeal and other members of the Cloud Resume Challenge community. If you have a novel idea for how to teach a cloud-related skill through the Cloud Resume Challenge paradigm, we'd love [your contribution](/contributors-guide.md).
