1. Challenge steps

Now you will provide the steps of the challenge one by one.
* There should be around 6 to 12 steps - no more than 15.
* Each step gives the user a task to do, like connect a database to a BI service.
* The steps can link to helpful guides or tutorials, but you shouldn’t explain every single action the user needs to complete in order to complete the step.
* The learner is expected to be able to Google to figure out some things throughout the project.
You’re not creating a step-by-step tutorial; you’re providing a spec, it’s up to them to figure out exactly how to implement it.
* The last step of the challenge should ALWAYS be for them to write a short blog post explaining what they learned.

4. [Extra credit (optional): Provide 2-3 additional tweaks to the challenge for “extra credit”. Common ideas are: add CI/CD, add a front-end dashboard, etc]

5. How to use this challenge in a job interview
